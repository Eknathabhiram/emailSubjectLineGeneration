**Email Subject Line Generation with Chatgpt 2 with AESLC dataset**

This repo has 2 Jupyter notebooks one which has steps to fine tune the model with whole dataset.
Second Notebook has steps to validate the generation using bleu score.


**Things to do**

* Implement validation score for whole dataset
* Try to implement the architecture mentioned in "This Email Could Save Your Life: Introducing the Task of Email Subject
  Line Generation(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03497.pdf)" paper.
* change validation metric from bleu as it is not suitable for this task
* Try to create a chrome extension out of this.
